# Project Name
> The project is meant to have a detailed investigation on bike sharing/rental. Based on the parameters like holiday, weekdays, season etc.. we try to analyse the rate of bike rental increase. A machine learning algorithm, Multiple Linear Regression has been used for this project.

## General Information
- Provide general information about the project here.
    - A MLR algorithmic case study on Bike Sharing.
- What is the background of the project?
    - I was given with a dataset of bike sharing team. BAsed on the dataset, the analysis and predictions has to happen for future rental business.
- What is the business probem that the project is trying to solve?
    - Predict the rate of bike rentals/shares based on different features like season, year, workingday, weekday, holiday, temp, hum etc..
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    - US Bike Sharing Provider, BoomBikes

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Understanding and Analysing the Data Set holds maximum of numeric values (no categorical/binary values included)
    -  Dependent variables - season, yr, holiday, weekend, weathersit, temp, hum, windspeed
    - Independent variables - cnt
- The count of customers keeps increasing rapidly every year
- The predictions depends on the variables - season, yr, holiday, weekend, weathersit, temp, hum, windspeed
- The plot has been normally distributed based on pvalue, rsquared and vif
